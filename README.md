## Time Taken

20 hours approximately.

The for first 4 hours, I had to plan it our the design and the architecture that I'd need to follow.
next 16 hours went into development and testing.

I'm still short of 6 hours to finish of some of the missing thing as per the assignment.

## Design decision

The design decision was make keeping key factors in mind like
	1. Scalability,
	2. Modularity
	3. Object Oriented
	4. Overridability of in-build functions
	5. Ease of readability and self explanatory
	6. Abstraction of method
	7. Dynamic dependency fetching
